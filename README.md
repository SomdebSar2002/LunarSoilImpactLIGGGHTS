This is a image representation of impact of chandrayan 2 footlander(here dropped at 1m/s) taken cross section of 4mm*4mm*4mm cube weighing 10kg(taking the fact that chandrayan 2 
lander weighs 1.6ton) on the lunar soil with lunar gravity and materials properties as well. Also the plot of stress and torques
acting on the cube is plotted with respect to the time as well as with respect to the depth
